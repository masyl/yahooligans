		<h1>Gatekeeper</h1>
		<p>
			How would you build a logic gate circuit simulator in javascript?
		</p>
		<h2>The solution in action:</h2>
		<div>
			The circuit is : <span id="circuitCode">a=nand(d,d,false);b=nor(d,a,true);c=nand(a,b,false);d=and(a,c,true)</span>
		</div>
		<p id="circuitOutput"></p>
		<p>
			I believe this approach is flexible, extensible, easy to work with. Some more work
			with the UI could generate circuit graphs using Canvas and edit and execute circuits
			live from user input.
		</p>
		<h2>Explanations</h2>
		<p>
			As I outlined during the interview, I started with a object model for gates for which
			the main behavior is common to all gates and the logic of each individual gate is injected
			using an anonymous function.
		</p>
		<p>
			A circuit is then created by instantiating a series of gates and setting up their
			input and initial states. Near the end, I took the liberty to create a shorthand
			language I called <strong>gatescript</strong> in order to quickly test different
			circuit scenarios quickly. The gatescript expression shown above is the one actually
			being executed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the gatescript expression is interpreted and the circuit instantiated, a
			"setInterval" clock is used to trigger each cycle of the circuit using the
			circuit "runner" which has been coded into the circuit object.
		</p>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="gatekeeper.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
	
			// Here is a sample of how to build a circuit using javascript
			// code instead of the gatescript notation
			/*
			var circuit = new Gatekeeper({
				"a": Gatekeeper.nand("d", "d", false),
				"b": Gatekeeper.nor("d", "a", true),
				"c": Gatekeeper.nand("a", "b", false),
				"d": Gatekeeper.and("a", "c", true)
			}, {
				drawToElementId: "circuitOutput"
			});
			*/


			// Output the state of the circuit to the UI
			drawCircuit = function (circuit) {
				var out = [];
				for (var iGate in circuit.gates) {
					out.push(iGate + "=" + circuit.gates[iGate].state);
				}
				document.getElementById("circuitOutput").innerHTML = out.join(" ");
			};
	
			var circuit = new Gatekeeper(document.getElementById("circuitCode").textContent);
			setInterval("circuit.tick().tock();drawCircuit(circuit);", 500);
